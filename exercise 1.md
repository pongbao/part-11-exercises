# CI/CD Exercise

Currently, I am working on a web-based application with a team of 5 people using vanilla React with NextJS, which is written in plain Javascript. All the linting is taken cared of by VSCode, our primary code editor, which has the necessary features for maintaining the readability and cleanliness of our code. The build process is already built in the NextJS capabilities, so we don't really have to worry much about that. We live by the test-driven development principle, which ensures all tests pass before we approve any pull request to any branch, including regression tests (so no new bugs are introduced). Deployment is also easy, as vercel automatically deploys any changes made on the main branch - the main branch is the same as the production branch, but vercel offers a "move to prodcution" option once the code is deployed in the development environment.

We primarily use Github Actions as part of the process when committing changes to branches, running tests, and merging with other branches, but if we our product scales largely, we might think about moving to Azure Pipelines (which flows directly into Microsoft Azure servers). Since our products and features are not that complex (i.e. we don't need high GPU usage), I believe that a cloud-based environment is suitable for our application.
